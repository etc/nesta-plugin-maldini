# Maldini #

Maldini is a [Nesta plugin][nestaplug] allowing citations and bibliographies to be automatically generated from [BibTeX][bibtex] files. It is intended to streamline the workflow of those who write content both in [LaTeX][latex] and for the web.  It is also intended to make [Nesta][nesta] the tool of choice for academic websites. For more on the idea behind Maldini, see the Maldini [project homepage][maldiniproject].

## Installation ##

Maldini is presently in pre-release development. The first official release, of version 0.0.1, will occur only when a `gem` is released to [rubygems.org][rubygems.org]. For now, the development version of Maldini may be installed by adding the following line to the Gemfile of your Nesta site:

    gem 'nesta-plugin-maldini', :git => 'git://github.com/etc/nesta-plugin-maldini.git'

For guidelines for working with Nesta plugin sources, see the [Nesta plugin][nestaplug] documentation.

## Usage ##

Maldini provides a syntax modeled on (a very small subset of) the syntax provided by [biblatex][biblatex] (it is basically a wrapper for [bibtex-ruby][bruby], which looks after the hard work of parsing the BibTeX file). The Maldini [project homepage][maldiniproject] is itself an example of how to employ Maldini. The source from which it is generated can be browsed [here][src], and the BibTeX file it employs can be browsed [here][maldinibib]. More detailed information can be found in the Maldini [YARD Documentation][maldiniyard], which is automatically generated every time the Maldini sources are updated.

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS ##

- [Graham Ashton][ashton] for the lovely [Nesta][nesta].
- [Sylvester Keil][keil] for the excellent [bibtex-ruby][bruby] and [citeproc-ruby][cruby] packages.
- Philipp Lehman for the indispensable [biblatex][biblatex].

## VERSION HISTORY ##

### 0.0.1 ###

- Initial skeleton release.
- Supported features:
  - Correctly parses LaTeX code in field data
  - Sorts reference list by surname, then first name, then year
- `Nesta::Plugin::Maldini::Bibliography` public methods:
  - `open()`
  - `textcite()`
  - `citeauthor()`
  - `parencite()`
  - `fullcite()`
  - `printbibliography()`
- Supported entry types:
  - `article`
  - `book`
  - `inbook`
  - `incollection`
  - `inproceedings`
- Unsupported entry types:
  - `unpublished`
  - `phdthesis`

## TODO ##

- Minor issues are flagged method by method in the source with "TODO".

### Known Issues ###

- Better treatment of cases where a bibliography contains authors with the same last name with multiple publications in a single year. Default behaviour should be to incrementally append a lowercase letter to the `year` field (Name, 2001a; Name, 2001b).
- [Heroku][heroku] deployments do not like bibliographies stored in the Nesta `attachments` directory.

### Milestones ###

#### 0.0.1 ####

- Automate testing with [RSpec][rspec] or something similar.

#### 0.0.2 ####

- Add support for DOI field, formatting as URI *iff* there is no URL field.
- Provide methods for citing page or section numbers, modeled on [biblatex][biblatex] syntax.
- Provide methods for simultaneously citing multiple entries, modeled on [biblatex][biblatex] syntax.

#### 0.1 ####

- Create [BibDesk][bibdesk] template for copying entries as Maldini citations.
- Allow bibliography file to be specified in custom Nesta metadata.
- Generate HTML marked up with identifiers to permit:
  - Customised styling of citations and (especially) reference lists.
  - Hyperlinks to references. 
  - Citation tooltips displaying the complete reference.
- Add support for entry notes, including notes that include [biblatex][biblatex] citations to other entries.

#### 1.0 ####

- Find a way to embed citations directly in Markdown pages, perhaps by totally re-engineering everything to utilise the [citation processing][citepandoc] implemented by [Pandoc][pandoc].
- Allow BibTeX file to be sourced directly from a [GitHub][github] repository, perhaps by accessing it through [libgit2][].
- Implement option to format citations in any format specified in [Citation Style Language][csl], by wrapping [citeproc-ruby][cruby].
- Add support for [Biber][biber].
