# Maldini #

Maldini is a [Nesta plugin][nestaplug] allowing citations and bibliographies to be automatically generated from a [BibTeX][bibtex] file. Maldini provides a syntax modeled on (a very small subset of) the syntax provided by [biblatex][biblatex].  Maldini is basically a wrapper for [bibtex-ruby][bruby], which looks after the hard work of parsing the BibTeX file.

Maldini is intended to streamline the workflow of those who write content both in [LaTeX][latex] and for the web.  It is also intended to make [Nesta][nesta] the tool of choice for academic websites.

## Installation ##

*Coming soon*. For now, see the [Nesta plugin][nestaplug] documentation.

## Usage ##

*Coming soon*.

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS ##

- [Graham Ashton][ashton] for the lovely [Nesta][nesta].
- [Sylvester Keil][keil] for the excellent [bibtex-ruby][bruby] and [citeproc-ruby][cruby] packages.
- Philipp Lehman for the indispensable [biblatex][biblatex].

## VERSION HISTORY ##

*Note*: Maldini is currently in pre-release development.  The first official release, of version 0.0.1, will occur only when a `gem` is released to [rubygems.org][rubygems.org].

### 0.0.1 ###

- Initial skeleton release.
- `Nesta::Plugin::Maldini::Bibliography` public methods:
  - `open()`
  - `textcite()`
  - `citeauthor()`
  - `parencite()`
  - `fullcite()`
  - `printbibliography()`
- Supported entry types:
  - `article`
  - `book`
  - `inbook`
  - `incollection`
  - `inproceedings`
- Unsupported entry types:
  - `unpublished`
  - `phdthesis`

## TODO ##

- Minor issues are flagged method by method in the source with "TODO".

### Known Issues ###

- Improve handling of various dashes in `pages` field. The best way to do this is probably to defer it to the [Haml][haml] processor, which [should][hamlredcarpet] in any case be using a [SmartyPants][smarty]-enabled processor such as [Redcarpet][redcarpet]. But it doesn't yet.
- Better treatment of cases where a bibliography contains an author with multiple publications in a single year. Default behaviour should be to incrementally append a lowercase letter to the `year` field (Author, 2001a; Author, 2001b).
- Reference list should be sorted alphabetically by default.

### Wishlist ###

- Generate HTML marked up with identifiers to permit customised styling of citations and (especially) reference lists.
- Find a way to embed citations directly in Markdown pages, perhaps by totally re-engineering everything to utilise the [citation processing][citepandoc] implemented by [Pandoc][pandoc].
- Provide methods for citing page or section numbers, modeled on [biblatex][biblatex] syntax.
- Provide methods for simultaneously citing multiple entries.
- Add support for entry notes, including notes that include [biblatex][biblatex] citations to other entries.
- Add support for DOI field, formatting as URI *iff* there is no URL field.
- Automate testing with [RSpec][rspec] or something similar.
- Allow BibTeX file to be sourced directly from a [GitHub][github] repository.
- Implement option to format citations in any format specified in [Citation Style Language][csl], by wrapping [citeproc-ruby][cruby].
- Add support for [Biber][biber].

Maldini is an existence proof that a total amateur can easily build a useful Nesta plugin.  For comments and suggestions, please contact [the author][brad].
